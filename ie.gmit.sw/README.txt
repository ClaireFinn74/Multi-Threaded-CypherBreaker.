Step-by-step guide on how to run my code:

1. My code will ask the user to input 1, 2 or 3.
2. If you press 1 you can input any message and it will come out encrypted with its own railfence (so the spys don't see it!)
You will also be displayed your original message with its own railfence.
3. If you press 2 you can input a file name and the console will decrypt the message within the file and display it in console.
If you do not specifically enter "ShieldsAndSwords.txt" (case sensitive) then the program will tell you the file name is incorrect.
4. If you press 3, the console will display a message from 4grams.txt.
5. Every time you want to enter in a new choice you have to re-run the application.

My program:

The program demonstrates Inheritance through using the keyword implements
Has an Interface containing abstract methods which are used throughout the other classes.
Demonstrates cohesion and coupling as errors occur when you try to make changes to one class and not the other related classes.
